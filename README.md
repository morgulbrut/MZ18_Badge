# MZ18_Badge

## Idea

 * ESP32 or ATSAMD21
 * Micropython or CircuitPython (or Arduino or Forth or Lua or Javascript ;))
 * CMWX1ZZABZ-078 AKA Murata module for LoRa Connectivity, using STs AT-Slave
 * Oled display and some LEDs
 * Maybe one or two sensors (BMP/E 280 for example)
 
## Projectplan
 * Oct 17: Prototype 1 design finished, featuring ESP32 and ATSAMD21 footprints, to test both. 0603 parts to be able to handsolder.
 * Nov, Dec 17: Prototype 1 manufactured and tested and decision which sensors should be used
 * Jan 18: Design freeze Proto 2.
 * Feb, March 18: Proto 2 manufactured and tested.
 * April 18: Design freeze Final.
 * May 18: Final produced.
